<h1 id="logicsim">LogicSim</h1>
<p><strong>LogicSim</strong> is a logic design simulator, written in C++ and Qt. LogicSim allows the simulation of digital circuits combining digital components, such as logic gates.</p>
<p>LogicSim is free and open-source.</p>
<h2 id="digital-circuits">Digital Circuits</h2>
<p>A digital, or logic circuit, is a type of circuit that involves digital signals. These types of circuits ignore various details important in analog circuits in order to simplify circuit design. Such circuits primarily use logic gates as their most basic components.</p>
<p>As such, digital circuits can be considered a layer of abstraction. Normally, basic components such as logic gates are created using lower level components, such as transistors. Such components do not often appear in digital design, making the logic gate the lowest level component in use.</p>
<h2 id="simulation">Simulation</h2>
<p>LogicSim is a logic design simulator, which means it allows for the design of custom logic circuits and simulates their real-world function.</p>
<p>In real circuits, there are various considerations that are not taken into account here. LogicSim uses a simplified model to simulate circuits, which will be explained in depth further on.</p>
