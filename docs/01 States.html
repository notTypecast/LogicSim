<h1 id="states">States</h1>
<p>In digital circuits, probing a wire at a certain spot often results in two states, 0 or 1. In reality, there are certain voltage ranges that are assigned to each of these and, depending on the voltage of a wire, the corresponding state is decided.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, because of the complicated nature of real world circuits, it is not always possible to assign one of these to a spot on the circuit with certainty. This creates issues for digital design, where a simplified model is used.</p>
<h3 id="state-model">3 State Model</h3>
<p>LogicSim uses a 3 state model to deal with this issue. Any spot in a circuit can be either of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logic 0 (False)</li>
<li>Logic 1 (True)</li>
<li>HiZ (Unknown)</li>
</ul>
<p>At the very beginning of a simulation, all outputs of non-input components are initialized to HiZ. Input components always output a 0 or 1, so their output is immediately set to that.</p>
<p>As the simulation progresses, components calculate their output based on their inputs and propagate it, often resulting in a valid circuit output.</p>
<p>Most components require inputs. Driving a componentâ€™s input means connecting some output to that input. Undriven inputs are considered HiZ. Each component handles HiZ in its inputs differently. For specific information on how a component does this, refer to its documentation page.</p>
