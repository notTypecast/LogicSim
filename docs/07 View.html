<p>The view menu allows for a few additional options. The toolbar can be toggled at <em>View &gt; Toolbar</em>.</p>
<p>Wire color can be toggled at <em>View &gt; Wire Color</em>. This is an option that applies to simulation mode. If toggled on, during simulation, wires that carry a logic 1 will turn green, wires that carry a logic 0 remain black and wires that carry HiZ will turn red.</p>
<p>There are also options to zoom in and out, as well as reset zoom level. Using these options from the <em>View</em> menu will result in the zoom happening around the center of the design area. Instead, <em>CTRL + Scroll Wheel</em> can be used to zoom in or out around the cursor.</p>
