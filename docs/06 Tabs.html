<p>LogicSim allows multiple simultaneous circuits to be opened. For each circuit, LogicSim opens a tab at the top of the design area. Opening a new file (while already having open files or unsaved circuits) results in the circuit opening in a new tab.</p>
<p>If a tab contains unsaved changes, a star (<em>*</em>) icon will appear next to its file name.</p>
