<p>D memory components are memory components that store 1 bit of information.</p>
<p>These components have 1 main input, <em>D</em>, as well as a clock input. This input is used to update the next state of the component.</p>

<p>D components can either be latches or flip flops. Latches will only change their state based on their <em>T</em> input when the clock signal is at 1, whereas flip-flops will only do so during a positive edge (clock signal switch from 0 to 1).</p>
