<h1 id="jk-memory-component">JK Memory Component</h1>
<p>JK memory components are memory components that store 1 bit of information.</p>
<p>These components have 2 main inputs, <em>J</em> and <em>K</em>, as well as a clock input.</p>
<p>JK memory components are similar to SR memory components, with the difference that the invalid inputs <em>S = 1</em> and <em>R = 1</em> are valid and toggle the output.</p>

<p>JK components can either be latches or flip flops. Latches will only change their state based on their <em>J</em> and <em>K</em> inputs when the clock signal is at 1, whereas flip-flops will only do so during a positive edge (clock signal switch from 0 to 1).</p>
<p>Note that, if the state of the component is HiZ, some inputs of this component will not have the intended effect.</p>
