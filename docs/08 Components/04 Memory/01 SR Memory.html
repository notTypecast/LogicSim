<h1 id="sr-memory-component">SR Memory Component</h1>
<p>SR memory components are memory components that store 1 bit of information.</p>
<p>These components have 2 main inputs, <em>S</em> and <em>R</em>, as well as a clock input. These inputs are used to set and reset the state of the component.</p>

<p><strong>Delay: 5 ticks</strong></p>
<p>Note that <em>u</em> refers to an undefined, since the input <em>S = 1</em> and <em>R = 1</em> is undefined for these components. With the current operation of the simulator, the actual output will be <em>Q = 1</em> and <em>Q’ = 1</em>.</p>
<p>SR components can either be latches or flip flops. Latches will only change their state based on their <em>S</em> and <em>R</em> inputs when the clock signal is at 1, whereas flip-flops will only do so during a positive edge (clock signal switch from 0 to 1).</p>
