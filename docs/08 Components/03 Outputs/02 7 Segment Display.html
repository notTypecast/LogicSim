<h1 id="segment-display">7 Segment Display</h1>
<p>The 7 Segment Display is an output device that displays a hexadecimal number (0-F). There are two versions of this device: the 5 and the 8 input devices.</p>
<p>The 5 input device uses its bottom most input (least significant bit) to determine the state of the dot, as well as the next 4 inputs to determine which hexadecimal number to display (input in binary).</p>
<p>The 8 input device allows more freedom in its control, since it provides the ability to turn each segment on or off individually.</p>
