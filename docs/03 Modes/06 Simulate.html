<h1 id="simulation-tool">Simulation Tool</h1>
<p>The simulation tool corresponds to the simulation mode. During simulation, other tools are disabled. The design view can be moved in the same way as when the move tool is active.</p>
<p>While in simulation mode, the simulation can be paused using the <em>Simulation &gt; Pause</em> option. When paused, the simulation can be stepped by the simulation frequency (in ticks) using the <em>Simulation &gt; Step</em> option. The simulation can then be resumed using the <em>Simulation &gt; Continue</em> option. At any point during simulation, the <em>Simulation &gt; Reset</em> option can be used to reset the simulation to tick 0. Finally, the <em>Simulation &gt; Stop</em> option can be used to stop the simulation.</p>
<p>All of these options can also be found on the toolbar.</p>
