<h1 id="move-tool">Move Tool</h1>
<p>The move tool allows for movement of the design area, which is achieved by clicking on empty space and dragging. Note that this implies movement of the design view, but not the components themselves. When moving the view, the componentsâ€™ positions remain the same.</p>
<p>This is important because, when saving a file whose view has been moved, opening the file again will return the view to its original position.</p>
